            <p>
              Revenulytics LLC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
              terminate your access to the Site and the related services or any
              portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent
              permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the
              State of California and you hereby consent to the exclusive
              jurisdiction and venue of courts in California in all disputes
              arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site
              is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to
              all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this
              section.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
              agency relationship exists between you and Revenulytics LLC as a
              result of this agreement or use of the Site. Revenulytics LLC's
              performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and
              legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in
              derogation of Revenulytics LLC's right to comply with
              governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
              relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or
              gathered by Revenulytics LLC with respect to such use. If any part
              of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
              pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
              warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above,
              then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
              superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
              matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of
              the agreement shall continue in effect.
